documentation
Welcome to the IBM Storage Fusion documentation, where you can find information
about how to install, maintain, and use IBM Storage Fusion.  This information applies to 2.8 and subsequent
2.8.0 fix pack releases.


Through its integration of a fully containerized version of IBM®'s general parallel file system and backup and restore software, IBM Storage Fusion provides organizations a streamlined way to
discover data from across the enterprise. In addition, you can use the software to virtualize and
accelerate existing data sets more easily by leveraging the most pertinent storage tier.
With the IBM Storage Fusion solutions, organizations can
manage only a single copy of data. No longer are they required to create duplicate data when moving
application workloads across the enterprise, easing management functions while streamlining
analytics and AI. In addition, data compliance activities (for example, GDPR) can be strengthened by
a single copy of data, while security exposure from the presence of multiple copies is reduced.
In addition to its global availability capabilities, IBM Storage Fusion integrates with IBM Cloud® Satellite to help enable businesses to fully manage cloud
services at the edge, data center, or in the public cloud with a single management page. IBM Storage Fusion also integrates with Red Hat® Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) for managing multiple Red Hat
OpenShift® clusters.
