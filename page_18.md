Enterprise registry for IBM Storage Fusion
installation
During the installation process, IBM Storage Fusion installs IBM Storage Fusion software using images hosted
in the IBM entitled registries. If you want to use your enterprise registry, you can install IBM Storage Fusion software from images that are maintained in a
container registry that you manage. 
In IBM Storage Fusion, JFrog Artifactory is the supported
enterprise registry.
Though the experience is same as using the IBM entitled and Red HatÂ® registry, you must do additional steps to set
up images in your private enterprise registry.
You are responsible for setting up and populating this private enterprise registry.
