Deploying IBM Storage Fusion services
In the service-based 
IBM Storage Fusion, choose the
features that you want to deploy. You do not have to install all the services at installation time
instead enable a feature that is available as a service on-demand basis.

As an administrator, you can install or enable the required services from the user interface, but
make sure you meet the resource requirements of individual services.
