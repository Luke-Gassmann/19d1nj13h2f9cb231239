Accessibility features for IBM Storage Fusion
Accessibility features assist users who have a disability, such as restricted mobility or
limited vision, to use information technology content or products successfully.
Accessibility features
IBM Storage Fusion includes the following major
accessibility features:
Keyboard-only operation
Operations that use a screen reader
Interfaces that are commonly used by screen readers
Keys that are discernible by touch but do not activate just by touching them
Industry-standard devices for ports and connectors
The attachment of alternative input and output devices


IBM® Documentation, and its related publications, are
accessibility-enabled. The IBM Storage Fusion online product
documentation in IBM Documentation (IBM Docs) is enabled for
accessibility. The accessibility features are described in IBM
Documentation at Accessibility.
IBM Storage Fusion uses the recent W3C Standard, WAI-ARIA 1.0 (www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/), to ensure compliance with US Section 508 (www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards/section-508-standards)
 and Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 (www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). To take
advantage of accessibility features, use the recent release of your screen reader and the recent web
browser that is supported by IBM Storage Fusion.

Interface information
The IBM Storage Fusion user interfaces do not have
content that flashes 2 - 55 times per second. 
The IBM Storage Fusion web user interfaces rely on
cascading stylesheets to render content properly and to provide a usable experience. The application
provides an equivalent way for low-vision users to use a user’s system display settings, including
high-contrast mode. You can control font size by using the device or web browser settings. 
The IBM Storage Fusion web user interface includes
WAI-ARIA navigational landmarks that you can use to quickly go to functional areas in the
application.
